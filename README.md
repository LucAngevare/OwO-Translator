# OwO-Translator

This is the shit translator for the shit language of OwO, this can fuck up your shit internet within seconds because it doesn't have a toggle button. Good luck with it!

# Details
So what did I do?
In the manifest.json you can see that it basically tells the shitstore of Chrome and Firefox that it's name is OwO TWANSWATOW, the version is 0.1 and that it has to go to the JavaScript file (content.js) for the actions.

# Actions
So what did I do?
In the content.js you can see that it checks if the page exists, and then replaces all r's with w's, and it doesn't matter where it is in the shitty webpage.

# License
I don't actually have a license, but I would appreciate credit if you used my script for something public.
